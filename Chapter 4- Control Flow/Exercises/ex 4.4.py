## Exercise 4: Stages of Life :ballot_box_with_check:
# Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a personâ€™s stage of life. 
# Set a value for the variable age, and then:
# If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
# If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
# If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
# If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
# If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.
# If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.
