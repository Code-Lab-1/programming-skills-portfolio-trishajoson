#Exercise 2: Glossary :ballot_box_with_check:

#A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary.
# However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.
# Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters.
# Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.

#Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. 
# You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning
# A function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.
# Certain functions, such as int or str, return a value instead of outputting it.
